  <h2>What I would introduce?</h2>
  <p>
    On the way of my previous career, I have done some projects and developed several products. Most of the works I have done were based on the Linux system and implemented by C/C++ language. I would not define myself as a typical embedded software engineer, since there are some teams in my company which could take care of the hardware platform and Linux kernel things. So, for me, I didn’t need to pay too much attention to the low level things such as circuit design and Linux driver. What I did is to utilize different chips’ sdk to complete the service logic processing of the device.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recognize that it’s not easy to show you how the devices work, and boring to demonstrate some communication theory here. So I would just show you some projects I recently did and something interesting.

    It’s a pretty interesting thing that, after years of programming work in embedded related systems, I have a chance to get some work done with Android, Java and Python. To be honest, I don't much about Java programming before this project. However, I would like to try something new, and that’s not bad to learn something about high level development, like application development. It let you know better about what’s the end users really want. It’s like an adventure, but I enjoy it.

  <h2>2. The second project I could show is this website</h2>
  <p>
    The idea to have a personal website flashed through my mind many times. I didn’t go down to it because I always wish my website being perfect, fancy and gorgeous. But I finally realize that I should just do it rather than think of it. Action speaks louder than words, right? 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a simple, easy organized website. And I just used html and some CSS to construct the static pages. Nevertheless, a thing is not usually as simple as it seems. To do things carefully is just pass, only to do things by heart can be excellent. It really takes time to make this site better, thinking about the style, designing the forms and writing the words (although there are still some typos on it). However, I’m happy to do it since it’s MY website. :}

  <h2>3. Two other things could be mentioned</h2>
  <h3>Translation of book "Mastering Algorithms with C"</h3>

    The original thought of translation was to share the knowledge. <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Mastering-Algorithms-C-Kyle-Loudon/dp/1565924533">“Mastering Algorithms in C”</a> is the most readable algorithms book I've ever encountered. And I was surprised that, after 10 years of its publishing, there wasn’t a Chinese edition to read yet. As most of the Chinese programmer didn’t have the habit to read English technique book, and this is an awesome book, I decided to translate this book from English to Chinese with one of my friends – <a href="https://cn.linkedin.com/pub/chen-ge/32/8a7/52b">Colin Chen</a>. It took us three months to translate the book and another month to revise the typos. Eventually, it was published in late 2012. This definitely was a unique experience I ever had. I’m so happy, exciting and proud of that.

  <h3>Technique blogger --- <a href="http://www.geekfan.net/">GeekFan.net</a></h3>
  <p>
    There are four co-founders of this website (include me). The purpose of building this site is to translate and share the latest tech news and articles (ex. Raspberry Pie, Arduino, Linux, Android, iOS) to Chinese tech-fans. We collect articles from TechCrunch, Hacker News, howtogeek, gizmodo, lifehacker, makezine, instructables and so on, then sort out several most innovative and interesting ones, and translate them into Chinese, finally publish them on our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    After I moved to Canada for a while, I stopped contributing to GeekFan.net and dropped off from the team, because I had a tight schedule of studies, and didn’t have enough time to handle all the works.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, GeekFan leaves me lots of wonderful memories, so glad that I have been a part of it.
