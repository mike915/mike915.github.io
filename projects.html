  <h2>What I would introduce?</h2>
  <p>
    On the way of my previous career, I have done some projects and developed several products. Most of the works I have done were based on the Linux system and implemented by C/C++ language. I would not define myself as a typical embedded software engineer, since there are some teams in my company which could take care of the hardware platform and Linux kernel things. So, for me, I didn’t need to pay too much attention to the low level things such as circuit design and Linux driver. What I did is to utilize different chips’ sdk to complete the service logic processing of the device.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recognize that it’s not easy to show you how the devices work, and boring to demonstrate some communication theory here. So I would just show you some projects I recently did or something interesting.

    I’m a person who always could and earn to learn a lot from work. However, at some spot of your career, you would feel that you have touched the ceiling of the job, you cannot absorb knowledge as much as you did before. If that happened, you can choose to leave and face the new challenge from the outside world. That's why I’m here.

  <h2>About study</h2>
  <p>
    It’s pretty nice that I could have the opportunity to come back to school after such a long years’ stay in industry. Campus environment not only brings me peace and ease, but also brings me confidence and motivation. School is a good place to learn knowledge, a nice place to re-battery and reload power and a great place to get you ready for the tough competition of the quickly changing world. I should have a thankful heart for every minute at school.
  </p>
  <p>
    People around here are nice, kind and friendly. If you open your heart, it’s not difficult to find somebody after your own heart. What I should do is to study hard, enjoy campus life and be up for the competitive future.

  <h2>Purpose behind the site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is constructed for people who know me, as well as who don’t know me. Whoever you are, you’re all more than welcome to this site.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe this website will let you know me better. You will find you who I am, what I am doing, and what I’m going to do? Again, although there are some projects showcases on this website, I’m not aiming to make this site as a resume page. I just want to make you know what I have done in the past couple of years.
