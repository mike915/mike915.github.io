  <h2>Idea 1: Go through your contact list, call someone you haven't been in touch for a while</h2>
  <p>
    A lot of people feel it's awkward and a little nerve racking to try to get back in touch with a friend they haven't spoken to in a while. Don't think like that, just take the phone, and call him/her. That's how the solid relationship built.

<div class="container">
  <h2>Idea 2: Spend some time to do exercise</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a man who loves sports very much. My favorite exercise is jogging. Most of the time, I would do jogging alone, and that is a right time for me to clean my mind and remind me to keep going.

<div class="container">
  <h2>Idea 3: Send your long-distance family surprise postcards</h2>
  <p>
    I'm always very happy when I receive a postcard from a friend, family or even a stranger. So why not to do the same thing to make others happy?

  <h2>Idea 4: Re-arrange all your books, and choose anyone you haven't read to read</h2>
  <p>
    Re-arrange them by color? Or by genre? Or by books youâ€™ve read vs. books you have yet to read? Books are our friend, and bring us knowledge. Just pick up one, and read it.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Idea 5: Discover the beauty of local community</h2>
  <p>
    I'm sure there are a plenty of beautiful things in your town or city. It could be a waterfront, an old church, a conservation area or even a trail. Whatever it is, go and discover it.
