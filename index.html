  <h2>Here I am</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Xiang Xiao, you can just call me Michael since I am aware of the fact that most people here found it hard to pronounce my name :). I am currently a master student studying computer science at McMaster University. Before I moved here (Canada), I have already completed my bachelor and master degree in China. Yes, don’t be surprised. The degree I’m pursuing here is my second master degree :). After that, I worked for two companies in China for more than five years in total. Okay, that’s who I am, because as a software engineer, as a developer, as a programmer, or as a coder, whatever, I always love to make things as easy, simple, brief as possible.

  <h2>About work</h2>
  <p>
    Well, I don’t want to make this section becoming a resume page, however, if you really prefer something more resume-style, feel free to go to my <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/xiangxiao">LinkedIn</a> website. Here, I would like to say something more casual and relaxed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first company I worked is an electronics manufacturing company which I stayed at for nearly two years. Our products are called “Customer Queue Systems”. Since every time I explained it to other people, they usually had no idea what is it. So I would like to put it in this way. Every time, when you go into a bank branch, the first thing you need to do is to get a ticket from a machine, then you could go to the waiting area for calling. After a while, when the bank teller pushes a button on the caller and meanwhile you see your number on the led display, you would be served. So the ticket machine, the callers and the led displays as a whole are named “Customer Queue Systems”.
  </p>

    My second company is a big telecommunication company which is excellent at researching and developing optical communication device. I worked on PTN products for about two years and spend another two years on developing IP RAN products. I know if you are not a telecommunication guy, you absolutely don’t know what I am saying. Yes, it’s true. I always believe communication is a special and important industry in the real world. Most of the popular technologies and electronic devices are based on the Internet, and the connections of the Internet is based on thousands or millions of telecommunication devices. To be a qualified communication software engineer, you need to be proficient in programming and communication protocol, and also are required to have some knowledge of hardware design. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a person who always could and earn to learn a lot from work. However, at some spot of your career, you would feel that you have touched the ceiling of the job, you cannot absorb knowledge as much as you did before. If that happened, you can choose to leave and face the new challenge from the outside world. That's why I’m here.

  <h2>About study</h2>
  <p>
    It’s pretty nice that I could have the opportunity to come back to school after such a long years’ stay in industry. Campus environment not only brings me peace and ease, but also brings me confidence and motivation. School is a good place to learn knowledge, a nice place to re-battery and reload power and a great place to get you ready for the tough competition of the quickly changing world. I should have a thankful heart for every minute at school.
  </p>
  <p>
    People around here are nice, kind and friendly. If you open your heart, it’s not difficult to find somebody after your own heart. What I should do is to study hard, enjoy campus life and be up for the competitive future.

  <h2>Purpose behind the site</h2>
  <p>
    This site is constructed for people who know me, as well as who don’t know me. Whoever you are, you’re all more than welcome to this site.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe this website will let you know me better. You will find you who I am, what I am doing, and what I’m going to do? Again, although there are some projects showcases on this website, I’m not aiming to make this site as a resume page. I just want to make you know what I have done in the past couple of years.

  <h2>What to do when I am bored</h2>
  <p>There are moments that we are inevitably to feel bored, this is absolutely normal, and trust me if you decide to spend more time on browsing around the Internet, things would get worse. So why don't we treat it as an opportunity?</p>
