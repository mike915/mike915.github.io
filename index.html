    <b> Purpose behind the site </b>
</h2> 

<p> <br>
Life is in fact getting easier and easier with uses of technology. However, people are less connected than before, and they may have hard time to find motivation to chase for their dreams, since they might perceive the world is saturated as they live in the Internet based world most of the time. The purpose of this website is to provide motivation, hints to this group of people based on my own experience, and the end goal I want to get is that people would live in a sustainable life that fills with Belief, Hope, and Love!
